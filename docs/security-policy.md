# Cryptographic security policy

This document describes library policy, not a certification or a promise to
erase memory owned by dependencies. Permanent refusals are reported as
`error::Policy::RejectedFeature { feature, reason }`; domain errors preserve
that cause. `RejectionReason` is a small typed explanation, not an error source.
Serde must render it through its format's native error envelope.

<a id="policy"></a>
## Runtime policy

`crypto::CryptoPolicy::from_libdefaults` builds a permission snapshot from the
current configuration. `check_use` applies permitted membership and explicit
legacy permission to requests, reply keys, session and ticket keys, cached and
imported credentials, acceptors and checked low-level APIs. Rebuild the snapshot
after changing configuration. Public configuration fields are staging values,
not evidence that a selection is authorized. Invalid staging values fail closed.

The implemented secure `DEFAULT` is AES-SHA2 then AES-SHA1: IDs
**[20, 19, 18, 17]**. DES3 and RC4 are never inserted by `DEFAULT`, even when
permitted. Both `allow_des3`/`allow_rc4` and permitted-list membership are needed
for their corresponding profiles (16/23). These flags do not insert names into
explicit request lists. Unlike MIT's KDC-side relations, this library enforces
them on clients and acceptors too: a deliberate, stricter divergence. A service
with only RC4 keys must opt in explicitly or it cannot accept those tickets.

Lists use MIT case-insensitive names/aliases, space/tab/CR/LF/comma delimiters,
`DEFAULT`, `aes`, `des3`, `rc4`, `camellia`, and left-to-right `+`/`-` operators.
Re-adding a present entry retains its position; re-adding a removed one appends.
Unknown, forbidden and policy-disabled positive terms fail by name, never silently
narrow. Known removal terms are accepted. Empty results fail. Compatible mode
skips only secure unimplemented Camellia with a diagnostic; strict mode rejects
it. No Camellia implementation is included. See
[MIT configuration](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.22/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html),
[encryption types](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.22/doc/admin/conf_files/kdc_conf.html#encryption-types)
and [MIT list evaluation](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/blob/krb5-1.22.2-final/src/lib/krb5/krb/init_ctx.c#L411-L492).

KDC-supplied password derivation has minimum **4096** iterations for AES-SHA1
([RFC 3962 section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3962.html#section-4))
and **32768** for AES-SHA2
([RFC 8009 section 4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8009.html#section-4)).
The existing upper bound is 2^24; zero is refused. Trusted application code may
lower a minimum with `LibDefaults::with_min_s2k_iterations`; doing so weakens
offline-guess resistance. Text configuration and serde cannot set that override.
Rejection occurs before PBKDF2. Raw RFC-vector primitives retain their documented
low-count behavior and do not enforce application permission; use
`crypto::checked::Etype` for policy-checked low-level operations.

Opaque historical key/cache/message records and peer capability advertisements
are not algorithm authorization. Explicit outgoing selection is checked before
crypto or transport. Draft-9 preferences are ignored with
`ConfigDiagnostic::IgnoredPreauthType`; text removes the entries, while serde
retains the informational IDs and `LibDefaults::diagnostics()` reports them via
`Cow<[ConfigDiagnostic]>`. Neither permits an outgoing draft-9 exchange.

<a id="single-des"></a>
## Single DES

`SingleDes`: inadequate effective key strength. IDs 1/2/3 and historical raw/HMAC
names are recognized only for rejection or removal. MIT disabled single DES by
default in **1.8** and removed support in **1.18**:
[1.8 release notes](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.8/krb5-1.8.html),
[1.18 release notes](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.18/krb5-1.18.4.html).

<a id="kerberos-v4"></a>
## Kerberos V4

`KerberosV4`: obsolete protocol and cryptography, not an available compatibility
mode. Enabled `krb4_*` selections are refused; disabled values are accepted.
MIT removed protocol support in **1.7**:
[release](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.7/),
[removal project](https://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Remove_krb4).

<a id="v4-conversion"></a>
## V4 conversion

`V4Conversion`: conversion into the removed security model is not implemented.
Enabled `krb4_convert`, `v4_*` mappings and realm selections are refused.
`default_domain` remains ordinary parsed metadata. MIT removed the krb524 daemon
and client implementation with **1.7**, but retained some principal-conversion
helpers and a compatibility stub; this is not a claim that every conversion API
vanished: [MIT removal project](https://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Remove_krb4).

<a id="rsa-pkinit"></a>
## RSA-mode PKINIT

`RsaPkinit`: removed RSA key-transport/DH-less protocol mode, not RSA signatures
on certificate chains. Explicit mode selectors, including historical
`flag_RSA_PROTOCOL=yes`, are refused before exchange. MIT removed this mode in
the **1.22** development cycle:
[removal commit](https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/401f584526e501b68e7516c17d8e467883f8f210),
[1.22 releases](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.22/).
Certificate filenames, trust anchors and revocation options are not classified
as RSA transport. Current PKINIT itself awaits plan 2.

<a id="draft9-pkinit"></a>
## Draft-9 PKINIT

`Draft9Pkinit`: obsolete Windows-era protocol variant, removed by MIT in
**1.18**: [release notes](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.18/krb5-1.18.4.html).
Explicit PA types 14/15 and enabling legacy selectors are refused. Preference
lists ignore them with diagnostics; KDC advertisements are ignored, not selected.

<a id="rc4-export"></a>
## Export-strength RC4

`Rc4Export`: deliberately reduced key strength. ID 24 and its aliases are
permanently refused, independent of legacy flags. This policy is stricter than
MIT's historical compatibility table: **no blanket MIT removal release is
claimed**. [RFC 6649](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6649.html) deprecates it;
[MIT enctype documentation](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.22/doc/admin/enctypes.html)
still describes historical support. Ordinary RC4-HMAC 23 is distinct and opt-in.

<a id="unauthenticated-checksum"></a>
## Unauthenticated or weak negotiable checksums

`UnauthenticatedChecksum { id }`: CRC32, raw MD4/MD5/SHA1 and historical weak
checksum selections do not provide acceptable authenticated integrity. Negotiable
IDs 1..10 and 14 are refused with the exact ID, including peer-selected KRB-SAFE
and PAC verification. Protocol-internal hashes and opt-in keyed HMAC-MD5 are
different constructions. **No blanket MIT removal release is claimed**:
[RFC 6649](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6649.html) deprecates named weak
profiles, while [MIT advisory 2010-007](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2010-007.txt)
documents specific checksum-acceptance fixes, not removal of all hash primitives.

<a id="unprotected-password-change"></a>
## Unprotected password change

`UnprotectedPasswordChange`: password mutations require confidential,
authenticated KRB-PRIV protection. NULL-enctype request payloads and explicit
weaker-mode/version selectors are refused before encoding or transport.
Versions 1 and 0xff80 denote protected change/set forms; the current request
encoder emits 0xff80. Unknown versions never trigger a plaintext fallback.
**No blanket MIT removal release is claimed**: protection is the protocol
requirement in [RFC 3244 section 2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3244.html#section-2)
and the [MIT password-change API](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-current/doc/appdev/refs/api/krb5_change_password.html).
After possible delivery, an unsigned reply is diagnostic only and cannot prove
success or rejection; outcome remains unknown without authenticated validation.

<a id="weak-crypto"></a>
## Blanket weak-crypto enablement

`WeakCrypto`: `allow_weak_crypto=true` is permanently refused; false is accepted.
Obsolete unauthenticated raw DES3 profiles are also refused. There is **no MIT
release removing the entire boolean**: this is an intentionally stricter crate
policy. MIT's [1.8 release](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.8/krb5-1.8.html)
made DES default-off, and [current configuration](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.22/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html)
distinguishes weak crypto and family-specific permissions. No Cargo feature
alone grants permission to use legacy algorithms.

<a id="residual-copies"></a>
## Secret ownership and residual copies

First-party owning passwords, keys and secret staging buffers use zeroizing
owners; borrowed convenience APIs leave input erasure to the caller. This is a
bounded guarantee, not a claim that every historical copy is erased:

- rasn `OctetString` and decoded ASN.1 storage can own key, ticket or plaintext
  copies that the crate cannot reliably erase through the dependency's API.
- RustCrypto cipher schedules and internal hash/HMAC/KDF state belong to their
  implementation types. No blanket erasure guarantee is made for those copies.
- Returned raw `Vec<u8>`/`String`, caller clones, transport/application buffers,
  allocator remnants, registers, stack spills, OS paging and core dumps are
  outside value-owner erasure guarantees. Callers must protect and erase what
  they own, avoid logging tokens, and control dumps and persistence.
- `panic=abort` does not run destructors and is not an erasure control.

Password-specific kpasswd DER uses first-party zeroizing writers to avoid known
rasn password copies; generic ASN.1 codecs still have the residuals above.
Closing a dependency residual requires a documented dependency erasure contract
or an ownership-preserving replacement, not just wrapping the first input copy.

<a id="windows-api-ccache"></a>
## Windows API credential cache

The legacy KfW `API:` cache is omitted by owner decision D13. It requires the
Windows-only CCAPI/server integration; this crate does not wrap MIT Kerberos or
load a native Kerberos implementation. [MIT cache types](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-latest/doc/basic/ccache_def.html)
describe API credentials held by a server process. API is not the separately
named MSLSA Windows LSA store. An explicit API cache request returns a typed
unsupported-store error; it never falls back to another identity or cache.
This is a platform/integration omission, not a claim MIT removed API caches.
