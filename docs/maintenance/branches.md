# Branch ledger

Every ref of the repository as of the merge of `release/0.3.0` into `main`
(todo 1 of the rskrb5-ng plan), with the disposition each one received. Each
row carries the tip SHA, the containment proof (method, exact command, and its
output when it was re-run) and the disposition. `origin/*` refs were
remote-tracking refs of `https://github.com/andrico21/rskrb5.git`, which is now
`https://github.com/andrico21/rskrb5-ng.git`; `release/0.3.0` merge target:
see `git log --first-parent main`. The final state and the upstream pull
request states are at the end.

Proof methods:

- `is-ancestor`: `git merge-base --is-ancestor <ref> <base>`, exit 0 = contained.
- `merge-tree no-op`: `git merge-tree --write-tree <base> <ref>` prints `<base>^{tree}` as its first line, so merging `<ref>` into `<base>` changes nothing.
- `patch-id` / `range-diff`: the change is present under another SHA.

## Branch model

- Trunk development happens on `main`.
- Work branches are local `work/*` branches only and are never pushed.
- Release tags `vX.Y.Z` are placed on `main` commits.
- PR-head branches (the `fix/*` branches and the four other kept branches above) are frozen: they are not deleted, rebased or force-pushed.
- `archive/*` tags hold the tips of deleted branches (`chore/deps-refresh`, `release/0.2.1`, `release/0.2.2`, `release/0.3.0`).

## Final state

Checked on 2026-10-27 with `git ls-remote --heads origin`,
`git ls-remote --tags origin` and `gh pr view` (read-only):

- Remote branches: `main` and the 15 frozen pull-request head branches below,
  16 in all.
- Remote tags: the upstream release tags `v0.1.0` (`203f78a`) and `v0.2.0`
  (`a17d210`), the `rskrb5-patched` release tags `v0.2.1` (`f441b11`) and
  `v0.2.2` (`58b27bb`), and the four archive tags
  `archive/chore/deps-refresh`, `archive/release/0.2.1`,
  `archive/release/0.2.2` and `archive/release/0.3.0`. No `rskrb5-ng` release
  tag exists yet.
- Local refs: `main`, local copies of the eleven `fix/*` PR-head branches, and a
  `work/*` branch only while a change is in progress.
- The repository is standalone: `gh api repos/andrico21/rskrb5-ng --jq .fork`
  prints `false` (since 2026-10-25).

## Upstream pull request state

Each frozen head branch is the head of one pull request. The state was first
recorded right after the repository left the fork network
(2026-10-25T16:51:06Z, todo 3 of the plan) and checked again on 2026-10-27.
The state of the fourteen `clelange/rskrb5` pull requests was the same both
times;
`Gittingc0dez/rskrb5#1` was not recorded on 2026-10-25 and was first recorded
on 2026-10-27. On 2026-10-27 every pull request's head commit equalled the
branch tip. These pull requests are a historical record: the
project doesn't maintain them, and nothing here comments on or edits them.
