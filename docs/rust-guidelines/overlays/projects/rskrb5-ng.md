# Project overlay: rskrb5-ng

**Load order:** core `RUST_GUIDELINES.md` ->
`overlays/domains/kerberos-credential-protocols.md` -> `overlays/domains/http-services.md`
-> this file.

`http-services.md` applies because the crate ships a server-side HTTP Negotiate Tower
layer (`NegotiateLayer`, which writes `401` challenge and reject responses) and an Axum
example that serves HTTP.

**Precedence:** strictest wins. Where the core, the two domain overlays, this file or a
sibling project's stricter practice that this file adopts pull apart, the stricter rule
applies. Nothing below weakens the core or a domain overlay (README, "The overlay
contract").

## The project (verified 2026-10-28)

Facts were measured on `main` at `5761ba7` in `andrico21/rskrb5-ng` (`git ls-remote
https://github.com/andrico21/rskrb5-ng refs/heads/main`), the commit of CI run
`40580987728`.

- **What:** `rskrb5-ng`, a pure-Rust Kerberos 5 client and service library (`Cargo.toml`
  `description`).
  - Package `rskrb5-ng`, version `0.3.0`; the lib target is `rskrb5_ng` (`Cargo.toml`
    `[package]` and `[lib]`).
  - Repository `andrico21/rskrb5-ng`, a standalone repository detached from the fork
    network: `gh api repos/andrico21/rskrb5-ng --jq .fork` prints `false`, and `.parent`
    and `.source` are `null`. Development happens on `main`, the default branch
    (`--jq .default_branch`).
  - It is an independent continuation of `rskrb5` (`clelange/rskrb5`). Upstream is not
    tracked: nothing is merged from it and nothing is proposed to it (`PROVENANCE.md`).
- **History:** the same code was published to crates.io as `rskrb5-patched` 0.2.1
  (2026-10-06) and 0.2.2 (2026-10-23) (`curl -A <agent>
  https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rskrb5-patched | jq -r '.versions[] | .num + " " +
  .created_at'`). `rskrb5-ng` itself is not published (`curl -A <agent> -w '%{http_code}'
  https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rskrb5-ng` prints `404`).
- **Consumer:** `kpasswd-rs` (at `76bc19b`, its `origin` `HEAD`) still vendors
  `rskrb5-patched` 0.2.1 as a **path dependency** (`crates/kpasswd-rs/Cargo.toml` line 62:
  `rskrb5 = { version = "0.2.1", package = "rskrb5-patched", path = "../../vendor/rskrb5",
  default-features = false, features = ["tokio"] }`) and denies warnings. So this crate's
  `[lints]` table runs inside the consumer's build.
- **Toolchain:** edition 2024 and `rust-version = "1.99"` (`Cargo.toml`); stable 1.99.1 is
  current (`rustup check`: `stable ... up to date: 1.99.1`). CI runs floating `stable`,
  `nightly-2026-10-03` for rustfmt, the second rustdoc run and fuzz, and `1.99.0` for the
  MSRV build (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). `src/lib.rs` has `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`;
  `.cargo/config.toml` sets `build.warnings = "deny"`.
- **Lint baseline:** 0 baseline entries. `rg -c lint-migration src tests examples fuzz`
  prints nothing (exit 1). The transition baseline, its generator and
  `scripts/lint-ratchet/` were deleted in `3c70076`; the CI `lint-gates` job fails on any
  `lint-migration` match.
- **Gates** (`scripts/lint-gates/`, run by the CI `lint-gates` job): every
  `scripts/lint-gates/*.py --self-test`, then `allow_gate.py --enforce`,
  `exception_gate.py --enforce` (the six sanctioned `expect` forms), `profile_eq.py
  --clippy-toml`, `completeness_check.py`, `facade_gate.py --enforce`, `prose_gate.py
  --enforce` (whole tree), `feature_closures.py check-ci .github/workflows/ci.yml` and
  `fuzz_lint.py --enforce`.
- **Feature closures:** 36 (`python3 scripts/lint-gates/feature_closures.py list | wc
  -l`), each a `closures` matrix entry in CI running `cargo clippy --all-targets <args>
  -- -D warnings` and `cargo test <args>`.
- **CI jobs** (`yq '.jobs | keys' .github/workflows/ci.yml`, 25 jobs): `fmt`, `closures`,
  `clippy-windows`, `lib-feature-sets`, `readme-commands`, `test`, `i686`, `docs`, `msrv`,
  `semver-checks`, `publish-dryrun`, `consumer`, `deny`, `audit`, `vet`, `machete`,
  `taplo`, `docs-validate`, `lint-gates`, `fuzz-build`, `package`; advisory
  (`continue-on-error: true`): `geiger`, `rustdoc-nightly-canary`, and the scheduled
  `mutants` (whole crate, 8 shards) and `fuzz`. CI run `40580987728` on `5761ba7`: 63
  jobs `success`, 2 `skipped`, 1 `failure` (the advisory `geiger`).
- **Tests:** `cargo test --all-features --no-fail-fast` passes 786 tests in 35
  `test result: ok` lines (measured on `5761ba7`).
- **Fuzz targets:** 12 (`ls fuzz/fuzz_targets | wc -l`): `ccache_parse`, `der_oid`,
  `gss_token`, `http_negotiate`, `kdc_reply`, `keytab_parse`, `kpasswd_reply`,
  `krb5_conf`, `krb_messages`, `name_parse`, `pac_parse`, `spnego_token`.
- **Review backlog:** closed. `docs/review/README.md` "Totals": 78 rows covering 100 keys;
  rows 75 fixed and 3 dismissed; keys 97 fixed and 3 dismissed.
- **Ambient inputs:** 12 audited environment readers, listed in `READERS` of
  `tests/ambient_guard.rs` and enforced by `cargo test --all-features --test
  ambient_guard`. `rg -c '# Ambient input' src` counts 16 sections. `LibDefaults::new()`
  reads nothing; `LibDefaults::from_env()` is the explicit constructor that reads `HOME`
  (`src/config.rs`).
- **Vendored rules:** `docs/rust-guidelines/` holds the core, the two domain overlays and
  this file with `SHA256SUMS`. The root `RUST_GUIDELINES.md` index names the pin and the
  re-vendor procedure. CI (`docs-validate`) runs `(cd docs/rust-guidelines && sha256sum -c
  SHA256SUMS)`, and `profile_eq.py --clippy-toml` checks `Cargo.toml` and `clippy.toml`
  against the vendored core.
- **Core updates for a new stable:** none. Stable stayed at 1.99.1 for the whole plan
  (`rustup check` at every wave end), so the core Section 9 profile is unchanged since
  this file's previous revision `82b29fe` (`git log --oneline 82b29fe..HEAD --
  RUST_GUIDELINES.md` prints nothing).

## Project rules

1. **The core and both domain overlays apply in full.** A gap is a dated deviation below,
   phrased as a task, never permission.
2. **Lint profile:** the core Section 9 profile, unchanged, in the root `Cargo.toml`, with
   **zero generated exemptions**. Only six `expect` forms are sanctioned:
   - on `#[cfg(test)]` modules, `clippy::missing_errors_doc`, `clippy::missing_panics_doc`
     and `clippy::too_long_first_doc_paragraph` (only those that fire) with
     `reason = "test code is not rendered API documentation"`, and
     `clippy::panic_in_result_fn` with `reason = "a test fails by panicking"`;
   - `missing_copy_implementations` on a secret-holding type, with
     `reason = "secret material must not be implicitly copied"`;
   - `#![expect(clippy::pub_use, reason = "public facade")]` in `src/lib.rs` only;
   - `clippy::missing_const_for_fn` with `reason = "deliberate: <path> - <why it must not be const>"`;
   - `clippy::unused_async_trait_impl` with `reason = "deliberate: <path> - <foreign trait> mandates async"`;
   - in `src/lib.rs` only, `#![cfg_attr(test, expect(dead_code_pub_in_binary, reason =
     "public API: unused inside the unit-test harness"))]`.
3. **No `#[allow]`/`#![allow]`/`cfg_attr(.., allow(..))` and no `unsafe` anywhere,**
   tests included. Environment-dependent tests set variables in a child test process.
4. **Every feature closure lints and tests clean.** The closures are computed from the
   `[features]` table of `Cargo.toml`, never hand-listed. Each one passes
   `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo test`. Clippy with
   `--all-features --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is clean too.
5. **The core's prose rules apply to all code:** cancel-safety sections, test docs,
   `Result`-returning tests, Drop audits and emptiness messages.
6. **Toolchain:** floating `stable` in CI (core Version Policy), never pinned;
   `rust-version` is the latest stable the crate was verified on, proven by an MSRV job.
7. **Dependencies** are at their latest major versions, with no pre-release pins.
8. **CI is the core Section 12 list plus `rmcp-server-kit`'s stricter practice,** all
   blocking: `fmt`; `clippy` and tests in every feature closure; `lib-feature-sets`;
   `readme-commands`; `test` on Linux, macOS and Windows; `i686`; `docs` (rustdoc
   `-D warnings` on stable and the dated nightly); `msrv`; `semver-checks`;
   `publish-dryrun`; `consumer` (the packaged crate as a path dependency with warnings
   denied, in the consumer's feature set and with default features); `deny`; `audit`;
   `vet`; `machete`; `taplo`; `docs-validate`; the lint gates; `package`. Advisory
   (`continue-on-error`): `geiger`, `rustdoc-nightly-canary`, and the scheduled `mutants`
   and `fuzz`.
9. **Releases go only through the tag-gated workflow.** `release.yml` runs after a green CI
   run, publishes only when a `vN.N.N` tag points at the commit, and publishes `--locked`.
   The tag is cut on a commit of `main`. Once a prior `rskrb5-ng` release exists,
   `cargo semver-checks` runs against it (`scripts/lint-ratchet/semver_baseline.py`; with
   none, it prints a notice and passes).
10. **Development files stay out of the published crate:** `RUST_GUIDELINES.md`,
    `docs/rust-guidelines/`, the lint scripts and `.cargo/` (`package.exclude`).
11. **Kerberos specifics:**
    - an explicitly configured enctype request list that names an enctype outside an
      explicit `permitted_enctypes` is **rejected with the enctype named**, never silently
      narrowed;
    - enctype tests assert on the **encoded** AS-REQ/TGS-REQ etype list;
    - every parser of attacker-controlled bytes has a fuzz target;
    - credential-mutating async functions carry a `# Cancel safety` section saying
      **NOT cancel-safe** (today 15 in `src`: `rg -c 'NOT cancel-safe: this mutates
      credentials on the KDC' src`).
12. **The frozen upstream PR heads are not maintained.** The `fix/*` branches and
    `rust-1-98-clippy-drift`, `hex-dev-dependency`, `export-padata-constants` and
    `kpasswd-verbatim-result-bytes` stay on the remote as they are, for the open upstream
    pull requests. They receive no commits and no deletion.
13. **Ambient inputs:** library code reads the environment only in named
    ambient-discovery constructors (`KRB5_CONFIG`, `KRB5CCNAME`, `KRB5_KTNAME`,
    `KRB5_CLIENT_KTNAME`, and `HOME` in `LibDefaults::from_env`). Each one is documented
    with an `# Ambient input` section and pinned by a guard test. There are no implicit
    reads anywhere else.
14. **A new stable Rust is adopted by procedure:** the core Section 9 profile is updated
    here by a reviewed commit, re-vendored, mirrored into `Cargo.toml`, and every new
    diagnostic is fixed directly. No exemption is added.

## Deviations to resolve (status 2026-10-28)

Each item is a task. "Todo N" refers to the owner's plan `rskrb5-ng-own-way`.

1. **Unpublished.** `rskrb5-ng` is not on crates.io
   (`https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rskrb5-ng` returns `404`). The release workflow and
   `docs/RELEASING.md` are ready; publishing waits for the owner.
2. **`kpasswd-rs` still depends on `rskrb5-patched` 0.2.1** (`crates/kpasswd-rs/Cargo.toml`
   line 62). Its migration to `rskrb5-ng` is the consumer's own task.

### Closed (2026-10-28)

The deviations recorded on 2026-10-25 that are now resolved on `main`, each with the
commits on `main` that closed it (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <commit> origin/main`):

- **Generated lint baseline** (rules 2 and 4): zero entries in `509c1c7` (todo 25), every
  feature closure strict in `856da18` (todo 26), the baseline and transition gates deleted
  in `3c70076` (todo 27), and the closures pipeline with Windows clippy in `bd6257a`
  (todo 28).
- **Open review backlog:** fixed or dismissed in `634adc6`, `2674c34`, `71ffd9c`,
  `340bfe0`, `4d42d0d`, `70fa923`, `ddf76cb`, `1f2019c`, `b804443` and `eec22c7` (todos 29
  to 38), indexed in `2c4a80b` (todo 39).
- **Parser fuzz coverage** (rule 11): 12 targets in `e283460` (todo 40).
- **Mutation-testing scope:** whole crate in 8 shards in `8dd1753` (todo 41).
- **Prose rules on upstream-origin code** (rule 5): the prose gate over a clean-paths
  ratchet in `1b54b82` (todo 7), burned down by the Wave 2 merges through `dbe2f48` (todos
  8 to 21), and enforced on the whole tree in `3c70076` (todo 27).
- **Dependency majors held back** (rule 7): latest majors and stable `pbkdf2` 0.13 in
  `13db033` (todo 6).
- **Implicit environment reads** (rule 13): `RSKRB5_DNS_SERVER` became an explicit option
  in `ddf76cb` (todo 35), `LibDefaults::new()` stopped reading `UID` and `HOME` in
  `b804443` (todo 36), and `%{uid}` expansion stopped reading `UID` in `1f2019c` (todo
  37).
- **New-stable procedure not written** (rule 14): `docs/lint-policy.md` added in `3c70076`
  (todo 27).

## Common alignment steps (every project)

- **Lint tables:** the core Section 9 profile, unchanged; project additions go on top.
- **`clippy.toml`:** the core sample; duplicates and proper nouns appended, each with a reason.
- **`.cargo/config.toml`:** `[build] warnings = "deny"`.
- **CI:** the full core Section 12 list, including rustdoc `-D warnings` and `cargo machete`.
- **Guideline file:** a `RUST_GUIDELINES.md` pointer or vendoring index naming this overlay,
  with any vendored copy pinned and checksum-verified, never a partial copy.
