# MIT krb5 parity

<!-- Generated from mit-krb5-parity.toml by tests/mit_parity_manifest.rs. Do not edit. -->

Target: MIT krb5 1.22.2 (`krb5-1.22.2-final`, released 2026-01-29), inventory of 2026-10-29, statuses as of `a6a1851`.

## Summary

| Status | Rows |
| --- | ---: |
| implemented | 36 |
| partial | 75 |
| absent | 42 |
| rejected | 8 |
| omitted | 1 |
| out-of-scope | 7 |
| total | 169 |

<a id="scope"></a>
## Scope

The manifest covers MIT's client and service library surface. D1 rows are
KDC, kadmind, database and C-ABI machinery: they are recorded as
`out-of-scope` and no API is provided for them. D2 rows are features MIT
removed or that are insecure by design: they are `rejected` with a typed
`error::RejectedFeature` and a section of
[the security policy](security-policy.md). D13 records the owner decision to
omit the legacy Windows `API:` credential cache.

Completion means the union of this manifest and
[the gokrb5 manifest](gokrb5-parity.md), not their intersection. Each row's
closing todo is the plan todo that makes it final; `P1-N` is plan 1 todo N
and `P2-N` is plan 2 todo N, listed in `docs/parity-todo-index.toml`.

<a id="rust-extension-points"></a>
## Rust extension points

MIT loads C plugin modules from `plugin_base_dir` and `module` directives. This
crate loads no code: `module` is `Config::UnsupportedDynamicModule` in every
mode, and plan 2 todo 3 adds statically registered Rust providers in place of
the C plugin interfaces.
