# gokrb5 parity

<!-- Generated from gokrb5-parity.toml by tests/gokrb5_parity_manifest.rs. Do not edit. -->

Target: `github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5/v8` v8.4.4 (commit `47cd2e7744531465a983bf457bac38e6ad8f4684`, released 2023-02-25). The observed upstream master `855dbc707a37a21467aef6c0245fcf3328dc39ed` is tracked separately and is not the pin. Inventory of 2026-10-29, statuses as of `a6a1851`.

This file is generated from [`gokrb5-parity.toml`](gokrb5-parity.toml); edit the
TOML and regenerate it with `cargo test --test gokrb5_parity_manifest` (a drift
leaves the regenerated copy in the test's temporary directory).

The target is relative: a row is required because gokrb5 v8.4.4 provides it.
Platform credential stores, FAST armor, PKINIT and the other MIT-only features
are not gokrb5 rows, but the combined target is the union of this manifest and
[the MIT krb5 manifest](mit-krb5-parity.md), so they remain required there. Only
C-ABI or system-library wrappers and server machinery are excluded globally
([scope](mit-krb5-parity.md#scope)). Behaviours of gokrb5 that a secure
superset must not copy are listed under
[Upstream behaviours not copied](#upstream-behaviours-not-copied).

| ccache | Credential cache parsing, writing, and collection names | covered-with-gated-evidence | unit tests cover FILE/WRFILE/DIR parsing, writing, lookup, cacheconf entries, JSON, and env/default names; unit and property tests cover the record-count bounds checked against the remaining input, including the 32-bit LengthOverflow arms in the CI i686 job; historical upstream clelange/rskrb5: GitHub Actions run 28073249506 passed external kinit and kvno ccache coverage with TESTPRIVILEGED=1 on ubuntu-latest | keep privileged kinit/kvno coverage green: run locally with scripts/run-gated-integration.sh before release; the fork's ci.yml has no Docker integration job |
| crypto | Kerberos cryptography | covered | unit vectors cover AES-SHA1, AES-SHA2, DES3-CBC-SHA1-KD, RC4-HMAC, nfold, string-to-key, checksums, message encryption, and tamper rejection; one CryptoPolicy governs every enctype use; DES3 and RC4-HMAC need allow_des3/allow_rc4, and RC4-EXP and single DES are typed rejections | - |
| messages | ASN.1 and Kerberos message wrappers | partial | translated gokrb5 DER fixtures decode and round-trip through rasn-backed wrappers; typed domain errors keep their causes | GO-messages-1: a dedicated U2U request constructor closes in P2-17; GO-iana-1, GO-types-1 and GO-asn1tools-1: public assigned-number tables, authorization-data handling and checked DER utilities close in P2-27 |

| client | AS/TGS client flows | partial | unit tests cover password/keytab/ccache login, AS/TGS exchange, referrals, renewal, S4U2Self, S4U2Proxy, diagnostics, write-back, and cache behavior; unit tests cover the renewal series: the refresh band from the current ticket life, auto-renewal pacing, and the AS fallback for an expired or refused renewal; historical upstream clelange/rskrb5: GitHub Actions run 28073249506 passed 40 Docker MIT client_integration tests on ubuntu-latest, including DNS-SRV, referrals, renewal, cached tickets, ccache, HTTP, and kpasswd | GO-client-1: logger and key-access contract close in P2-6; GO-client-2: authenticated changed-client referrals and the logger; P2-28 closes the row; GO-client-3: U2U request constructor closes in P2-17; keep full Docker MIT integration green: run locally with scripts/run-gated-integration.sh before release; the fork's ci.yml has no Docker integration job |
| service | AP-REQ/AP-REP service validation | partial | unit tests cover AP-REQ validation, replay cache, clock skew, client address checks, AP-REP mutual auth, mutual-required completion enforcement (classifier and send wrappers fail closed), [libdefaults] clockskew on the Config-driven acceptors, keytab adapters, and PAC checksum validation; historical upstream clelange/rskrb5: GitHub Actions run 28073249506 passed Docker HTTP/SPNEGO service acceptance, raw KRB5 Negotiate, and replay rejection on ubuntu-latest | GO-service-1: logger contract and settings equivalence close in P2-6; keep Linux Docker HTTP/SPNEGO coverage green: run locally with scripts/run-gated-integration.sh before release; the fork's ci.yml has no Docker integration job |
| gssapi-spnego | GSSAPI, SPNEGO, and HTTP Negotiate tokens | partial | MIC, Wrap, SPNEGO token, raw KRB5 Negotiate, AP-REP verification, HTTP helpers, Tower middleware, and high-level header generation are covered; transport-agnostic async and blocking HTTP client wrappers retry 401 Negotiate responses through replayable request factories | GO-spnego-2 and GO-gssapi-1: credential delegation and a general mechanism/context interface close in P2-18; GO-client-6 and GO-service-3: HTTP client conveniences, cookies, redirects and the session manager close in P2-26; keep HTTP wrapper tests green in CI and Docker SPNEGO integration green locally before release |
| pac | PAC and NDR parsing | partial | unit tests cover PAC container data, validation info, credentials, UPN/DNS, S4U delegation, device info, claims, compression, server signatures, and AD credential summaries | GO-pac-1 and GO-credentials-3: KDC-checksum verification and a credential-attribute model close in P2-22; run TESTAD=1 against a maintained AD lab and keep it green before claiming full AD parity |
| docker-mit | Docker MIT KDC integration fixtures | covered-with-gated-evidence | focused forwarded-port configured-KDC AS login passed locally; full local direct-container-IP run timed out to 192.168.215.x:88 on macOS Docker networking; historical upstream clelange/rskrb5: GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch run 28073249506 passed Docker-backed integration on ubuntu-latest with INTEGRATION=1, TESTPRIVILEGED=1, TEST_KPASSWD=1, and TEST_DNS_KDC=1 | run scripts/run-gated-integration.sh run, and again with TEST_KPASSWD=1, locally before release; the fork's ci.yml has no Docker integration job and its workflow_dispatch declares no inputs |
| active-directory | Active Directory integration | blocked-on-lab | AD integration tests exist, the lab contract is documented in docs/ad-integration.md, TESTAD_REQUIRED=1 fails when the strict gate would otherwise soft-skip, lab-specific keytab path/hex/base64 overrides are supported, scripts/check-ad-integration-env.py preflights strict AD runs, scripts/check-github-ad-gate.py checks GitHub secret readiness and refuses to dispatch while ci.yml has no AD job, docs/ad-lab-provisioning.md documents the live AD lab contract, and docs/github-ad-gate-setup.md documents the secret setup a restored AD job needs; tests/client_ad_integration.rs statically verifies the embedded AD keytab fixtures contain testuser1, testuser2, testuser3, and sysHTTP principals with AES128, AES256, and RC4 key material; historical upstream clelange/rskrb5: GitHub Actions run 28119806826 passed the hosted keytab secret-shape dry-run job (upstream dispatch input test_ad_dry_run=true); historical upstream clelange/rskrb5: GitHub Actions run 28117082548 reached hosted ubuntu-latest and decoded the four keytab secrets before failing because the four endpoint secrets were absent | GO-doc-1: maintained live MIT, Samba and Windows AD evidence for this commit closes in P2-28; strict AD parity stays deferred: TEST_AD_USER_KDC_ADDR, TEST_AD_RESOURCE_KDC_ADDR, TEST_AD_USER_ADMIN_ADDR, and TEST_AD_RESOURCE_ADMIN_ADDR are unavailable and the fork's ci.yml has no AD job; do not add random or placeholder endpoint secrets; endpoint secrets must identify real reachable AD services; use docs/samba-ad-feasibility.md only as a backup spike, not as Windows AD parity evidence; to restore a hosted AD gate, add an AD job and its workflow_dispatch inputs to ci.yml, then run scripts/check-github-ad-gate.py before dispatching it; after strict AD is available, run scripts/check-ad-integration-env.py before TESTAD=1 TESTAD_REQUIRED=1 with lab-specific keytabs as needed and record keytab login, no-preauth login, user-domain PAC, and resource-trust PAC evidence |
| non-goals | Not required by gokrb5 alone (target-relative scope) | intentionally-out-of-scope | gokrb5 v8.4.4 has no API, KCM, KEYRING, MSLSA or MEMORY credential stores, FAST armor, PKINIT or system GSSAPI/SSPI facade, so they are not gokrb5 parity rows; the combined MIT and gokrb5 superset still requires the in-scope ones, tracked in docs/mit-krb5-parity.toml; only C-ABI or system-library wrappers and D1 server machinery are excluded globally | keep unsupported-store errors typed until the MIT manifest rows close (plan-2 todos 7-8 and 11-14) |

| GO-T2-1 | AES-SHA2 decrypts before authenticating | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | The HMAC is verified in constant time before any decryption (RFC 8009 section 5); no unauthenticated plaintext reaches callers or errors. | `crypto::AesSha2Etype` | - | `src/crypto.rs::sha2_rejects_bad_tag_before_any_decryption`, `src/crypto.rs::integrity_failure_erases_scratch` |
| GO-T2-2 | AS-REP reply encryption enctype is not constrained by request list | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | The reply-key enctype must be one the request offered and the policy permits before any key derivation, and the session-key enctype is checked too (Client::EnctypeNotRequested, CryptoPolicy). | `crypto::CryptoPolicy::check_use` | `tokio` | `tests/client/login_preauth.rs::initial_as_rep_outside_requested_enctypes_is_rejected`, `tests/client/as_exchange.rs::process_as_rep_rejects_session_key_outside_requested_enctypes`, `tests/policy/client.rs::as_reply_rejects_excluded_key_before_crypto` |
| GO-T2-3 | TGS-REP server identity checks are commented out | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | Both the decrypted sname and the ticket sname are bound to the requested service (Client::ServicePrincipalMismatch); the referral exception is limited to a cross-realm TGT form. | - | `tokio` | `tests/client/tgs_exchange.rs::process_tgs_rep_with_referral_accepts_intermediate_tgt`, `tests/client/as_exchange.rs::rejects_as_rep_ticket_service_mismatch` |
| GO-T2-4 | AP-REQ identity comparison omits realm | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | The acceptor compares the authenticator realm and ordered name components with the ticket's (RFC 4120 section 3.2.3) and returns the ticket-derived identity. | `service::Validator` | `messages` | `tests/service.rs::rejects_authenticator_client_realm_mismatch` |
| GO-T2-5 | AP-REP verification unimplemented | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | The AP-REP is decrypted and matched to the authenticator; with mutual authentication requested, the HTTP wrappers return MutualAuthenticationNotProven unless the final response proves it. | `service::VerifiedApRep` | `http` | `tests/http.rs::blocking_mutual_wrapper_rejects_a_missing_ap_rep`, `tests/http.rs::mutual_mask_matrix_rejects_unproven_responses`, `tests/http.rs::completion_rejects_invalid_metadata` |
| GO-T2-6 | SPNEGO mechListMIC is declared unused for Kerberos | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | The acceptor verifies supplied mechListMICs, requires one for a non-first Kerberos selection and replies with a reciprocal MIC (RFC 4178); the initiator verifies the acceptor MIC on completion. Multi-round continuation fails closed until plan-2 todo 18. | `spnego::AcceptedContext` | `spnego` | `tests/spnego.rs::acceptor_rejects_unverified_mech_list_mic`, `tests/spnego.rs::acceptor_rejects_nonfirst_kerberos`, `tests/spnego.rs::mech_list_mic_accepts_nonfirst_and_authenticates_response`, `tests/http.rs::completion_verifies_acceptor_mic` |
| GO-T2-7 | Replay protection is process-wide and unbounded | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | Replay caches are per instance or explicitly shared, bounded (65,536 records and 300 s skew by default), expire records and fail closed when full. | `service::ReplayCache` | `messages` | `tests/service.rs::replay_lifecycle_capacity_preserves_live_records`, `src/service/replay/policy_tests.rs::capacity_default_and_custom_limit_are_enforced` |
| GO-T2-8 | CCache parser uses input-derived counts/slices without bounds checks | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | Every principal component, address and authorization-data count is checked against the remaining input before memory is reserved (Ccache::Truncated, Ccache::LengthOverflow on 32-bit targets). | `ccache::CCache::parse` | - | `tests/ccache.rs::rejects_impossible_component_count`, `tests/ccache.rs::rejects_impossible_address_count`, `tests/ccache.rs::rejects_impossible_auth_data_count`, `tests/ccache.rs::parse_never_panics_on_arbitrary_input` |
| GO-T2-9 | KDC TCP frame length is used directly for allocation; UDP buffer truncates | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | TCP record marks are 31-bit, the reserved bit is rejected and the configured size cap is checked before allocation (RFC 4120 section 7.2.2); an oversized UDP datagram is Client::UdpResponseTooLarge. | `client::transport::kdc_tcp_record_length` | `tokio` | `tests/client_transport/cases.rs::kdc_tcp_rejects_reserved_bit_before_body_read`, `tests/client_transport/cases.rs::udp_transport_rejects_truncated_datagram`, `src/client/transport/framing.rs::reserved_record_bit_is_rejected` |

| GO-T2-11 | TGS reply verification omits ticket version, transited policy and requested enctype policy | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | tkt-vno and authenticator-vno other than 5 are rejected, the requested session enctype is enforced, and a cross-realm ticket without TRANSITED-POLICY-CHECKED needs an explicit TransitPolicy. Profile-driven capaths transit validation is plan-2 todo 17 (MIT-client-5). | `service::TransitPolicy` | `messages` | `tests/service.rs::service_rejects_nested_ticket_version`, `tests/service.rs::transit_rejects_unchecked_cross_realm_paths`, `tests/service.rs::transit_policy_rejects_mismatching_paths`, `tests/client/tgs_exchange.rs::process_tgs_rep_rejects_session_key_outside_requested_enctypes` |
| GO-T2-12 | Principal normalization is not consistently RFC-canonical | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | Host-based constructors fold the DNS host component to lower case (RFC 4120 section 6.2.1) so host-case variants share one principal and cached ticket; service names and realms keep their case. | `client::principal::Principal::host_based_service` | `messages` | `tests/client_principal.rs::host_based_service_folds_dns_host_case`, `tests/client_principal.rs::host_based_service_preserves_service_and_realm_case` |
| GO-T2-13 | Configuration parser silently ignores unsupported/unknown keys and some section features | rejected | unit | ALREADY | - | - | Unknown sections and relations are ConfigDiagnostic values, ParseMode::Strict makes every diagnostic an error, and settings stricter than current behaviour fail in both modes (plan-1 todo 15). | `config::Config::diagnostics`, `config::diagnostic::ParseMode` | - | `tests/config/diagnostics_e.rs::unknown_paths_preserve_scope_and_finality`, `src/config/diagnostic_tests.rs::every_diagnostic_promotes_to_error`, `tests/config/sections_d.rs::server_only_sections_are_not_silent` |
| GO-T2-14 | ASN.1 helper length parsing is low-level and caller must validate | partial | unit | WP-20 | P2-27 | Public checked app-tag and length utilities with explicit size and nesting budgets (P2-27); raw convenience codecs keep their documented prefix decoding. | No unvalidated length helper is public; the internal SPNEGO DER reader bounds slices, rejects indefinite and non-minimal lengths and checks OIDs. | - | - | `src/spnego/der/tests.rs::der_lengths_reject_nonminimal_forms` |

## Status values

Feature rows use `implemented`, `partial` (the `missing` column names the gap
and its closing todo) and `absent`; behaviour rows are `rejected` when the
gokrb5 behaviour is not copied and `partial` while a fix is outstanding. Areas
and gates use these values:

- `covered`: unit and fixture evidence is sufficient for every row of the area.
- `covered-with-gated-evidence`: implemented and unit-covered, but release
  confidence depends on keeping a live Docker or privileged gate green.
- `covered-needs-ad-evidence`: implemented and unit-covered, but AD parity is
  not proven until `TESTAD=1` runs against a maintained lab.
- `partial`: at least one row of the area is not implemented yet.
- `needs-live-evidence`: implementation may exist, but current proof is not
  broad enough for a release parity claim.
- `blocked-on-lab`: code exists, but external infrastructure is required.
- `historical-upstream`: the gate was captured green only by the upstream
  `clelange/rskrb5` workflow; this repository's CI doesn't run it (see
  [`gated-integration.md`](gated-integration.md)).
- `proven`: the named gate has been captured green on the required platform.
- `unproven`: the proof target is known but has not been captured.
- `missing-api`: supporting pieces exist, but the user-facing API is missing.
- `intentionally-out-of-scope`: not required by gokrb5 alone; see the scope above.

## Deferred blockers

- Active Directory parity is blocked on reachable USER and RESOURCE AD
  endpoints; see [`ad-integration.md`](ad-integration.md). Do not add random or
  placeholder endpoint secrets.
- Use [`samba-ad-feasibility.md`](samba-ad-feasibility.md) as a backup spike
  only; Samba results are not Windows AD parity evidence.
