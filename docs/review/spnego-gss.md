## GSS boundary validation

RFC 4121 section 4.1.1 requires checksum type `0x8003`, a sixteen-byte Bnd
with little-endian length, context flags and an authenticator sequence number.
Delegation framing requires option 1, the declared credential bytes and a
decodable KRB-CRED envelope. Credential import/decryption is not implemented by
this acceptor; the delegation builder is covered by its separate row above.

The service validator invokes an internal GSS check after decryption, identity
and clock checks, but before replay insertion. Ordinary AP-REQ validation does
not run that check. No second decryption or public result-field change is needed.
The API supplies no channel bindings, so it ignores Bnd content as permitted by
section 4.1.1.2; it also ignores unknown flags and trailing extensions. Positive
controls cover these cases, zero and maximum sequence numbers, and a framed
delegation envelope. Additional tests cover raw Kerberos headers and corrupted
authenticator ciphertext. No principal-forgery or channel-binding enforcement
claim is made.

## One-shot acceptor integrity and scope

Only `1.2.840.113554.1.2.2` and `1.2.840.48018.1.2.2` are accepted. The optimistic
OID must occur in the offer; non-first selection requires a mechListMIC per
RFC 4178 sections 4-5. A supplied first-choice MIC must also verify. The signed
payload is the received MechTypeList TLV, excluding its explicit `[0]` wrapper.
No reconstruction, sorting or alias substitution changes the transcript.

RFC 4121 MIC decoding, direction, sequence and checksum checks run after AP-REQ
decryption and policy validation but before replay insertion. Verification uses
usage 25 and the authenticator subkey or ticket key. No acceptor subkey exists
yet. Responses carry accept-completed, the selected OID, AP-REP and (when an
initiator MIC verified) an acceptor MIC using usage 23 and the AP-REP subkey if
provided, otherwise the initiator subkey or ticket key. The acceptor MIC's
sequence number is the configured AP-REP one, otherwise the authenticator's; in
that fallback the AP-REP enc-part carries the same number, because MIT
initiators read the acceptor sequence number from the AP-REP (0 when absent).
`mech_list_mic_response_sequence_is_in_ap_rep` decrypts the AP-REP
independently and compares its seq-number with the MIC's SND_SEQ. The
first-choice no-MIC fixture remains byte-identical. Tests construct MIC headers independently and
call only the lower-level AES checksum primitive, not the MIC implementation.

Absent required MICs return `MissingMechListMic`; malformed, tampered, wrong-list
or context-inconsistent MICs return `InvalidMechListMic`. Unsupported mechanisms
return `UnsupportedMechanism`; unoffered optimistic OIDs return
`OptimisticMechanismMismatch`. All continuations still return
`NegotiationRequiresState`: this one-shot API cannot correlate a NegTokenResp
with a previous offer, established key, request-mic phase or consumed sequence.
It supports MICs already present in the initial token, not request-mic round
trips. In particular, an MS-first/standard-inner token without a MIC still fails
closed; this is not a claim of compatibility with all Windows SSPI exchanges.

The mechanism-selection change addresses the acceptor only, as requested. The
original review's initiator/HTTP response-classifier observations remain outside
that change; its row does not claim those client-side paths have been repaired.

## Header resource boundary

The 64 KiB cap is a local policy, not an RFC maximum. Checking the whole borrowed
header before splitting or trimming bounds scanning as well as decoded allocation;
it also prevents whitespace from bypassing the cap. Encoders and raw token codecs
are unchanged. Existing small-header and raw Kerberos fixtures remain supported.
The regression tests require the named size error: `is_err()` alone would also
pass when an oversized input allocates and then fails DER parsing. Scratch failure
QA removes only the cap and its constant, retaining the error declaration so the
three rejection tests compile and fail while the three controls pass.
