const SCOPE: &str =
    "This file is generated from [`gokrb5-parity.toml`](gokrb5-parity.toml); edit the
TOML and regenerate it with `cargo test --test gokrb5_parity_manifest` (a drift
leaves the regenerated copy in the test's temporary directory).

The target is relative: a row is required because gokrb5 v8.4.4 provides it.
Platform credential stores, FAST armor, PKINIT and the other MIT-only features
are not gokrb5 rows, but the combined target is the union of this manifest and
[the MIT krb5 manifest](mit-krb5-parity.md), so they remain required there. Only
C-ABI or system-library wrappers and server machinery are excluded globally
([scope](mit-krb5-parity.md#scope)). Behaviours of gokrb5 that a secure
superset must not copy are listed under
[Upstream behaviours not copied](#upstream-behaviours-not-copied).

/// Fixed prose at the end of the document.
const STATUS_VALUES: &str = "## Status values

Feature rows use `implemented`, `partial` (the `missing` column names the gap
and its closing todo) and `absent`; behaviour rows are `rejected` when the
gokrb5 behaviour is not copied and `partial` while a fix is outstanding. Areas
and gates use these values:

- `covered`: unit and fixture evidence is sufficient for every row of the area.
- `covered-with-gated-evidence`: implemented and unit-covered, but release
  confidence depends on keeping a live Docker or privileged gate green.
- `covered-needs-ad-evidence`: implemented and unit-covered, but AD parity is
  not proven until `TESTAD=1` runs against a maintained lab.
- `partial`: at least one row of the area is not implemented yet.
- `needs-live-evidence`: implementation may exist, but current proof is not
  broad enough for a release parity claim.
- `blocked-on-lab`: code exists, but external infrastructure is required.
- `historical-upstream`: the gate was captured green only by the upstream
  `clelange/rskrb5` workflow; this repository's CI doesn't run it (see
  [`gated-integration.md`](gated-integration.md)).
- `proven`: the named gate has been captured green on the required platform.
- `unproven`: the proof target is known but has not been captured.
- `missing-api`: supporting pieces exist, but the user-facing API is missing.
- `intentionally-out-of-scope`: not required by gokrb5 alone; see the scope above.

## Deferred blockers

- Active Directory parity is blocked on reachable USER and RESOURCE AD
  endpoints; see [`ad-integration.md`](ad-integration.md). Do not add random or
  placeholder endpoint secrets.
- Use [`samba-ad-feasibility.md`](samba-ad-feasibility.md) as a backup spike
  only; Samba results are not Windows AD parity evidence.
